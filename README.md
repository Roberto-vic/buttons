Just a small Project where I set buttons from DEFAULT to DANGER.

 1. Default with hover an effect.
 2. Bordered with hover and focus effect.
 3. Just text, also with an hover and focus effect.
 4. With disabled shadow.
 5. Two disabled buttons, first one default and second just text.
 6. Two buttons with icons
 7. Three different sizes: small, medium and large.
 8. With 4 different styles.
